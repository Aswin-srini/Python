**Stone-Paper-Scissor Game â€” Python Console Application**
**Technologies Used:** Python, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), File Handling  

**Project Overview:**  
Developed an interactive console-based Stone-Paper-Scissor game using Python. The game allows users to play against the computer with a user-friendly interface and a scoring system that persists game results.

**Key Features:**
- Designed using Python classes to encapsulate game logic and player details.
- Implemented `random` module to generate computer choices.
- Incorporated a scoreboard system using file handling (`score.txt`) to log game history.
- Handled input validation, match outcomes (win/loss/draw), and dynamic updates to player and bot scores.
- Displayed remaining chances and provided final results at the end of the session.
- Built modular code across multiple files (`Game_modul.py`, `score.py`, `main.py`) promoting reusability and separation of concerns.
